1. Set up your development environment:

+ Install Go (Terraform providers are typically written in Go)
+ Set up your Go workspace
+ Install Terraform
+ Do shit with environment variables

2. Understand the Terraform plugin system:

+ Familiarize yourself with Terraform's plugin architecture
+ Study the Terraform Provider Development documentation

3. Design your provider:

+ Determine which Hyper-V resources and data sources you want to manage
+ Plan the schema for each resource and data source

4. Implement the provider:

+ Create the main provider structure
+ Implement resource CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
+ Implement data sources
+ Use the Hyper-V API or PowerShell commands to interact with Hyper-V

5. Write tests:

+ Implement unit tests for your provider
+ Create acceptance tests to verify real-world behavior

6. Build and test your provider:

+ Compile your provider
+ Test it locally with Terraform


7. Document your provider:

+ Write documentation for each resource and data source
+ Provide examples of how to use your provider


Now that we have a small understanding of what's needed lets get the ball rolling with step one.



# Setup the environment for creating a provider.

# Setting up Go for Terraform Provider Development

   1. Download Go:
      - Visit the official Go download page: https://golang.org/dl/
      - Choose the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
      - Download and run the installer

   2. Set up Go workspace:
      - Create a directory for your Go workspace, e.g., `mkdir ~/go`
      - Set the GOPATH environment variable to this directory:
        ```
        export GOPATH=~/go
        export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
        ```
      - Add these lines to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`)

   3. Verify Go installation:
      - Open a new terminal window
      - Run `go version` to check if Go is installed correctly
      - Run `go env` to verify your Go environment variables

   4. Install Go tools:
      - Run `go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest`
      - Run `go install github.com/golang/lint/golint@latest`

   5. Set up your IDE:
      - Choose an IDE with good Go support (e.g., VSCode, GoLand, or Vim with Go plugins)
      - Install relevant Go extensions for your chosen IDE

   6. Install Terraform:
      - Visit https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
      - Download the appropriate package for your OS
      - Extract the package and move the `terraform` binary to a directory in your PATH

   7. Verify Terraform installation:
      - Open a new terminal window
      - Run `terraform version` to check if Terraform is installed correctly

   8. Set up version control:
      - Install Git if not already installed
      - Configure Git with your name and email:
        ```
        git config --global user.name "Your Name"
        git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
        ```

   9. Create a new repository for your Terraform provider:
      ```
      mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/yourusername/terraform-provider-hyperv
      cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/yourusername/terraform-provider-hyperv
      git init
      ```

   10. Install Terraform SDK:
       - Run `go get github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/v2/helper/schema`
       - Run `go get github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/v2/plugin`

   Your development environment is now set up and ready for Terraform provider development!
