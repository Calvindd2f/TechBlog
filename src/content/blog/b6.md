`odata.maxpagesize` can't be greater than the **ODataServicesMaxPageSize** server setting for on-premises and 20000 for online.


 online are set up to use a maximum of 20,000 entities per page by default.


Paging divides the data feed of a request into smaller chunks, or pages, which can't contain more than a specific number of entities.


## HTTP Response code anticipation with arrays

##### HTTP status codes

The following table lists and describes the HTTP status codes that can be returned by the graph api specifically, while these response codes do have an RFC for their actual status message - it is best to check the API you are calling for their description of what it means, the graph api has the status message as a short description but the actual meaning under `Description` in their documentation. 

| Status code | Status message                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Error Structure - Graph Example

A good frame of reference is creating an enum / struct / pscustomobject based on MGraph beta API error handling properties.

#### JSON representation

The error resource is composed of a single resource:

```JSON
{
  "error": {
    "code": "string",
    "message": "string",
    "innererror": { 
      "code": "string"
    },
    "details": []
  }
}
```

```JSON
{
	"error": { 
		"code": "badRequest", 
		"message": "Uploaded fragment overlaps with existing data.",
		"innerError": { 
			"code": "invalidRange", 
			"request-id": "request-id", 
			"date": "date-time" 
		} 
	} 
}
```

-------------------------

#### Error Structure Example

| **code**       | string       | An error code string for the error that occurred                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **message**    | string       | A developer ready message about the error that occurred. This shouldn't be displayed to the user directly.                               |
| **innererror** | error object | Optional. An additional error object that might be more specific than the top-level error.                                               |
| **details**    | error object | Optional. A list of additional error objects that might provide a breakdown of multiple errors encountered while processing the request. |
#### Properties

The **code** property contains a machine-readable value that you can take a dependency on in your code.

The **innererror** object might recursively contain more **innererror** objects with additional, more specific error **codes** properties. When handling an error, apps should loop through all the nested error codes that are available and use the most detailed one that they understand.

The **message** property is a human-readable value that describes the error condition. Don't take any dependency on the content of this value in your code.

The **message** property at the root contains an error message intended for the developer to read. Error messages aren't localized and shouldn't be displayed directly to the user. When handling errors, your code shouldn't take any dependency on the **message** property values because they can change at any time, and they often contain dynamic information specific to the failed request. You should only code against error codes returned in **code** properties.

The **details** property is an optional array of error objects that have the same JSON format as the top-level error object. In the case of a request that is composed of multiple operations, such as a bulk or batch operation, it might be necessary to return an independent error for each operation. In this case, the **details** list is populated with these individual errors.

## Few PowerShell examples

Here is a very privative and generic API request that is shows it's it
s strength in the error handling. 

```powershell

    .PARAMETER ApiMethod
