To open a port on a modern residential Sagemcom router using DSL, you'll need to access the router's configuration interface and set up port forwarding. Here's a general guide on how to do this, based on the information you've provided:

1. Access your router's web interface:
   - Open a web browser and enter your router's IP address (typically 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1)
   - Log in with your admin credentials
2. Navigate to the port forwarding section:
   - Look for options like "Port Forwarding", "NAT", or "Virtual Server"
3. Create a new port forwarding rule using the options you mentioned:
   - EnableService: Set this to "Enable" or "On"
   - Protocol: Choose the appropriate protocol (TCP, UDP, or Both)
   - External: This is the port number that will be open to the internet. Choose a port number (e.g., 4321)
   - hostInternal: Set this to the IP address of the device you want to forward the port to (192.168.1.1)
   - hostExternal: Leave this blank or set it to your router's public IP address (you can find this by searching "What is my IP" on Google)
   - PortInternal: Set this to 4321 (the port on your device that you want to expose)
   - PortOptions: If available, you might want to set this to "Static" since you mentioned the IP is static
4. Save the settings and apply the changes
5. Test the port forwarding:
   - You can use online port checking tools to verify if the port is open and accessible from the internet

Additional considerations:

1. DMZ: Since you mentioned the device is in DMZ, be aware that this exposes the entire device to the internet. It's generally more secure to use specific port forwarding rules instead of DMZ.
2. Security: Ensure that the service you're exposing on port 4321 is secure and properly configured to handle incoming connections from the internet.
3. Firewall: Make sure your router's firewall (if enabled) is not blocking the port you're trying to open.
4. ISP restrictions: Some ISPs might block certain ports or services. If you have trouble, you may need to contact your ISP.
