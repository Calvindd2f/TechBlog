This is more of a diary entry then a walkthrough.

Expect a bit more internal-monologue instead of instructions or opinionated takes:

Bootloader unlocked!
DerpFest 10 AOSP Installed
Boot into your up to date TWRP/OrangeFox or what ever recovery you are using.
Wipe system, data, vendor and caches
Flash fw (Credit ReloadedOS)
Flash the lineage-kek-17.1-20201025-UNOFFICIAL-lavender.zip
Install GApps. (optional) [Recommended -> Open GApps (arm64) (10.0) Nano]
Install latest Magisk (!), wipe caches afterwards. (This is mandatory)
Reboot.
Grant Team420-Terminal and Team420-Nethunter Apps all permissions they are asking for.
Start up the Nethunter App, select chroot manager, and install your preferred kali chroot (minimal recommended). Make sure that your screen does not turn off during this process.
When the installation is complete (after ~3-20 minutes) start up the kali chroot.
