# Improving Your PowerShell Function

+ **Tip #1: Functions Should Do One Thing**
Functions should have a single purpose and perform only one task. This makes them easier to understand, test, and maintain.

+ **Tip #2: Functions Should Be Testable**
Functions should be designed to be testable. This means they should be self-contained and not rely on external variables or state.

+ **Tip #3: Functions Should Be Self-Contained**
Functions should not rely on external variables or state. Instead, they should accept all the necessary parameters to perform their task.

+ **Tip #4: Add Comment-Based Help**
PowerShell has a feature called comment-based help that allows you to provide clear guidance on what your function does and how to use it.

+ **Tip #5: Use The PowerShell Function Naming Convention**
PowerShell uses a Verb-Noun syntax for functions and cmdlets. Use this convention to make your functions consistent and easy to understand.

+ **Tip #6: Leverage Advanced Functions**
Advanced functions provide a set of features that can improve your functions, such as support for common parameters and pipeline input.

+ **Tip #7: Support the Pipeline**
Functions should support the pipeline to make them more flexible and reusable.

+ **Tip #8: Support `-WhatIf` If Making Changes**
If your function makes changes to the system, it should support the -WhatIf parameter to allow users to test the function without making actual changes.

+ **Tip #9: Support `-Confirm` if Making Changes**
If your function makes changes to the system, it should support the -Confirm parameter to prompt the user for confirmation before making changes.

## A Well-Structured PowerShell Function

```powershell
function Get-IPAddress {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Retrieves the IP address of the local machine.

    .DESCRIPTION
    This function retrieves the IP address of the local machine.

    .PARAMETER ComputerName
    The name of the computer to retrieve the IP address for.

    .EXAMPLE
    Get-IPAddress -ComputerName "localhost"
    #>

    [CmdletBinding()]
    param (
        [string]$ComputerName = "localhost"
    )

    # Function code here
}
```

**Suppressing Output in PowerShell**

```powershell
# Assign to $null
$arrayList = [System.Collections.ArrayList]::new()
foreach ($i in 0..10000) {
    $null = $arraylist.Add($i)
}

# Cast to [void]
$arrayList = [System.Collections.ArrayList]::new()
foreach ($i in 0..10000) {
    [void] $arraylist.Add($i)
}

# Redirect to $null
$arrayList = [System.Collections.ArrayList]::new()
foreach ($i in 0..10000) {
    $arraylist.Add($i) > $null
}

# Pipe to Out-Null
$arrayList = [System.Collections.ArrayList]::new()
foreach ($i in 0..10000) {
    $arraylist.Add($i) | Out-Null
}
```

**Using Hash Tables for Faster Lookups**

```powershell
$Results = $Employees | ForEach-Object -Process {
    $Email = $LookupHash[$_.Name].Email
    [pscustomobject]@{
        Id    = $_.Id
        Name  = $_.Name
        Email = $Email
    }
}
```

**Avoiding Repeated Calls to a Function**

```powershell
# Bad example
for ($i = 0; $i -lt 10000; $i++) {
    MyFunction
}

# Good example
MyFunction -Count 10000
```
