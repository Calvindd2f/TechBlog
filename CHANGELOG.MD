+ Pretty much changed everything because I couldn't implement dark mode how I wanted it.
+ A lot of cool functionality and use in the site, it's faster.

> [Complete] (@Calvindd2f): Fix the blog display page. `/blog` and `/Blogs` are equally fucked. It still displays in '90s HTML though and is a presentable eyesore.
> [Complete] (@Calvindd2f): Redirect `404s` to `418` for shits and giggles.
> [Complete] (@Calvindd2f): Double check all `.env` and then secret scan `CI/CD`.
> [Complete] (@Calvindd2f): Not urgent but implement tags and catagories properly.
> [Complete] (@Calvindd2f): Disable toolbox before prod.
