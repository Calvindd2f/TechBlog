# Git Repo for Tech Blog

+ Astro Starter Kit: Blog - is used for the backend / hosting.  
+ The domain where it is hosted is: https://app-support.com  

+ The repository is cloned and an obsidian vault is used for markdown creation for Blog posts etc with relative ease.  
+ There is not anything else to document here really... Git is source control... NVim/VSC for IDE???
+ GD for domains DNS managment  
+ Nja.la for the VPS hosting the website (if I don't switch it over to github hosting)  

---------------------------------

## Did a major migration of the content. [04.09.2024]

+ Pretty much changed everything because I couldn't implement dark mode how I wanted it.
+ A lot of cool functionality and use in the site, it's faster.

#TODO(@Calvindd2f): Fix the blog display page. `/blog` and `/Blogs` are equally fucked. It still displays in '90s HTML though and is a presentable eyesore.

#TODO(@Calvindd2f): Redirect 404s to 418 for shits and giggles.

#TODO(@Calvindd2f): Double check all .env and then secret scan CI/CD.

#TODO(@Calvindd2f): Not urgent but implement tags and catagories properly.

#TODO(@Calvindd2f): Disable toolbox before prod.
